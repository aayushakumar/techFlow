# TechFlow App

**TechFlow** is a project management web application that streamlines the task creation and management process for tech project ideas. The app provides an interactive interface for users to submit their project ideas and automatically generates organized tasks, helping development teams manage workflows effectively with integrations to **Linear**.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

### Key Features:

1. **Task Board**:

   - When users land on TechFlow for the first time, a **Task Board** is shown featuring a **"Create New Task"** box.
   - This box serves as a starting point for users to navigate to the input form.

2. **Create New Task**:

   - Clicking on the **Create New Task** box takes the user to an **Input Form** where they can fill in essential details about their project idea, including:
     - **App Idea**: A brief description of the application to be developed.
     - **Main Features**: Key functionalities or features that the user wants in the application.
     - **Tech Stack**: Technologies and tools preferred for development.
     - **Deadline**: The anticipated deadline for project completion.

3. **Task Generation**:

   - Upon submitting the form, the input data is sent to the **groq API**, which generates a structured set of tasks based on the user's input.
   - These generated tasks are then sent to **Linear** for task management and storing tasks for user to work upon in the Backlog.

4. **Task Board Display**:
   - After submitting the input form, the user is redirected back to the **Task Board**, where they can view all the tasks generated based on their initial input.
   - Users also have the option to **create additional tasks** directly from the Task Board.

## Tech Stack

The TechFlow app is built with the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: React+ Typescript (with Redux-Saga for state management)
- **API Integration**: groq API (for task generation) and Linear (for task management)
- **Backend**: Express JS hosted on Vercel

## Usage

1. **Landing on Task Board**:
   - When the user first arrives at the TechFlow app, they are presented with a **Task Board** featuring a **Create New Task** box.
2. **Creating a New Task**:
   - Click on the **Create New Task** box to open the Input Form.
   - Fill in the details regarding the app idea, features, tech stack, and expected deadline.
   - Submit the form to generate a set of tasks.
3. **Viewing Generated Tasks**:
   - After submitting, the user is redirected back to the Task Board, where they can view the tasks generated by groq API and managed through Linear.
4. **Adding More Tasks**:
   - Users can create additional tasks directly from the Task Board using Create New Task feature which again would lead to Input Form.
